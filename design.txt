Makefile usage:
---------------
make: creates the .class file and executes the Main.java file to output the result
make clean: removes the .class files


This assignment implements three CPU schedule algorithms
1) FCFS
2) SJF (Shortest job first)
3) Round-Robin Scheduling

There are mainly 4 java class

1) Main.java:
------------
This java class inputs from the input file in.txt and outputs the result by calling other three java classes which implements the algorithms


2) FirstComeFirstServe.java:
---------------------------
This java class implements the first come first serve algorithm


3) ShortestJobFirst.java:
------------------------
This java class implements shortest job first algorithm


4) RoundRobin.java:
-------------------
This java class implements Round-Robin Scheduling algorithm

Besides, these 4 class i have also included;
input file: in.txt
and other helper class for different algorithms
